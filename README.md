### 🌱 Welcome to the Intersection of AI, Quantum, and Nature

Hi, I’m **Ahmed**, an **AI Engineer at Talan Tunisia** and a **Quantum AI Researcher**.  
Here, I believe **AI should speak with clarity** — a balance of **science** and **art**.

🔍 I build things that blur lines. Lines between **research**, **design**, **understanding**, and **the unknown**.  
💡 I explore **quantum principles**, **agent-based AI**, and **trustable systems** that **make AI interpretable**.

---

### 🌟 What Do I Do?
**Research-driven AI** + **Nature-inspired Algorithms** + **Quantum Interactions**  
I create **multi-agent systems**, dive deep into **quantum computing**, and build systems that **evolve** with human-like thought processes.

#### Here are some of the exciting things I’m working on:
- **Nature Algorithms** 🧬 – Inspired by patterns like **Fibonacci**, **Quantum Spin**, and **Quantum Annealing**.
- **AI Trust** 🤖 – Designing AI that **learns to trust** itself (and us), evolving from black-box to **transparent agents**.
- **Quantum AI Models** ⚛️ – Finding the parallels between quantum computing and **neural network design**.

### 🔄 My Research Explorations

> **Quantum AI in the NISQ Era: A Relevance Taxonomy**  
> Accepted as a **poster** at [IEEE QCNC 2025 – Nara, Japan 🇯🇵](https://www.ieee-qcnc.org/2025/)

*Pioneering an understanding of **Quantum AI** in the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) Era.*  
I’m fascinated by **quantum phenomena**, their **mathematical foundation**, and their **application to real-world AI models**.  
My focus: **Quantum-inspired AI architectures** that could redefine **machine learning**.

---

### 💡 Some Cool Algorithms I’ve Created

- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization** ⚛️  
- **Nature-Like Agent Coordination** 🌲  
- **Quantum Annealing Search Models** 🧩  
- **Self-Reflecting AI Agents** 🤖  
- **Causal Inference Using Graphs** 🌐

I love exploring how **mathematical beauty** plays into the **architecture of intelligence**. Every algorithm, every line of code is a **pattern**, a dance of logical beauty.

### 🧠 Latest Research: Quantum Meets AI

For me, **quantum computing** is not just about qubits — it's about finding **new computational perspectives** that will eventually evolve into **AI breakthroughs**. I'm working on a model that connects quantum principles with **multi-agent systems**. By mimicking quantum behaviors, such as **superposition** and **entanglement**, these agents can become self-reflective, **adaptive**, and **interoperable** in new environments.

---

### 📡 Latest Work - **Agents Powered by Trust**

#### **My Approach to Trustable AI**
> We live in a world of uncertainty, so should AI?  
> My mission is to ensure that **AI agents** can explain **why** they took a certain action, **how** they interpret their environment, and how they **grow** with interactions.

I’m using **multi-agent frameworks**, inspired by **LangChain**, **SmolAgent**, and **Autogen**, to create systems where agents work **collaboratively** and **transparently**.
