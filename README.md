### 🚀 The Mission

This isn’t a portfolio.  
It’s a sandbox. A lab. A journal. A whisper from the edge.

I’m **Ahmed**, and I work where **AI meets constraints** —  
low-power boards, edge devices, quantum bits, and tiny clues from nature.

I build things that:
- 🪰 Detect flies in real time using embedded YOLOv10  
- 📱 Turn math into AR adventures with OCR + GPT  
- 🧠 Mix QML with strange cost functions on real NISQ devices  
- 🌀 Try to learn from **how nature settles into low-energy states**  
  *(...not sure why, but there's something beautiful in that)*

### 🧬 New: Research Paper Accepted!

> 🎉 My research  
> **"Quantum AI in the NISQ Era: A Relevance Taxonomy"**  
> has been accepted as a **poster presentation** at  
> [IEEE QCNC 2025 – Nara, Japan 🇯🇵](https://www.ieee-qcnc.org/2025/)  

Somewhere between hardware limits and quantum chaos,  
this paper maps the relevance of quantum algorithms to noisy systems.  
More coming soon — open experiments, questions, maybe even art.

### 🔮 The Vibe Here

Every two weeks, I’ll drop:
- a small AI use case ⚙️  
- a wild idea behind it 🧠  
- and open it for you to remix 🔁  

Expect weird:
- Quantum intuition from physics & forest trails  
- Edge AI with flavors of constraint and elegance  
- Thought loops, rare books, and whispered insights
